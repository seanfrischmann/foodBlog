		<p class=ingredients>
			&#8226 Dry rubbed roasted garlic spice mix<br>
			&#8226 Baked at 350&#176; for approximately 1.5 hours<br>
			&#8226 Drizzled with a balsamic vinegar<br>
			&#8226 Served with sides of pasta with a red sauce and broccoli 
			with a hummus sauce<br>

			Review: Presetation is ok, broccoli could have looked nicer. 
			Flavor in broccoli was kind of bland. Pasta looked and tasted 
			good. Pork flavor was good, however, was  little on the drier 
			side. Overall, the meal could be prepared a little better.
