		<h3>Pork Tenderloin</h3>
		<h4>Preparer: Gabe</h4>
		<img  class="dinner6-11-13" src="images/porkTenderloin.jpg">
		<p class="ingredients">
			&#8226; Dry rubbed roasted garlic spice mix<br>
			&#8226; Baked at 350&#176; for approximately 1.5 hours<br>
			&#8226; Drizzled with a balsamic vinegar<br>
			&#8226; Served with sides of pasta with a red sauce and broccoli 
			with a hummus sauce<br>
		</p>

			Review: Presetation is ok, broccoli could have looked nicer. 
			Flavor in broccoli was kind of bland. Pasta looked and tasted 
			good. Pork flavor was good, however, was  little on the drier 
			side. Overall, the meal could be prepared a little better.
